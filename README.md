# Introduction

This repository provides the source code and binaries for a CLI that outputs variable-length DSA & LO7 strings to the
console.

## Usage

The .NET 4.5 framework needs to be installed; however, WINE & Mono are also supported.

Please run the executable from the command line with either `dsa` or `lo7` as the inbound argument.

## DSA

The DSA strings are the product of human-driven randomisation, i.e. keyboard mashing.
This is the product of approximately 4 years of evolution in encrypting and simplifying the typing of "What are you
currently up to, my dear friend whom I cherish the existence of? :)".

The following table shows the evolution of DSA-generation over the years:

| Sequence                           | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `What are you currently up to? :)` | Original, human-readable text which expresses enthusiasm and interest in your fellow peer.              |
| `what are you doing`               | Slightly simplified in terms of grammar & phrasing. Much more casual.                                   |
| `wot are u doing?`                 | Incorporating a style bound to the normality of your usual millennial's typing.                         |
| `wtounDDSAwotundsa,.msDA`          | Early stages of the DSA sequence. The transition between what are you doing and mashing DSA is visible. |
| `wountSA?D><AS?D><?SAD`            | Type-2 sequence, with significant regression in demonstrating cognitive abilities.                      |
| `SA?<DAS?<A?DS<>?D?SADD?`          | Evident case of null enthusiasm for being alive.                                                        |
| `dsa`                              | Transcendence into a new dimension.                                                                     |

## LO7

The LO7 strings are the result of spiting the usual way of pretending to laugh over text: `LOL`.
It is an outdated, boring, and asymmetric phrase. By introducing symmetry and novelty, the Yin-Yang `LO7` has been
introduced. The string can be rotated without a loss in its readability.

For further expression of laughter, the `A` character has been introduced, thereby resulting in `LOA7`.
For extensive vocalisation, the vowels can be elongated: `LOOOOOOOOAAAA7`. To combine the randomisation of DSA with the
genuine laughter when expressing `LOA7`, the characters can be randomised: `LOOAO7LAO7LOAL7OALO76LAO7`.
